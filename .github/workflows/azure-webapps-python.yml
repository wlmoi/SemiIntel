# This workflow will build and push a Python application to an Azure Web App when a commit is pushed to your default branch.
#
# This workflow assumes you have already created the target Azure App Service web app.
# For instructions see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/quickstart-python?tabs=bash&pivots=python-framework-flask
#
# To configure this workflow:
#
# 1. Create a Service Principal in Azure with contributor role
# 2. Create GitHub Secrets:
#    - AZURE_CLIENT_ID: Service Principal Application (client) ID
#    - AZURE_TENANT_ID: Service Principal Directory (tenant) ID  
#    - AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID: Your Azure Subscription ID
#    - AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET: Service Principal client secret
#
# 3. Change the value for the AZURE_WEBAPP_NAME. Optionally, change the PYTHON_VERSION environment variables below.
